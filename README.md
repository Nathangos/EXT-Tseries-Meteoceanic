# EXT_Tseries_
Simulation of univariate extreme time series accounting for temporal dependence

For better modelling surge-induced coastal flooding, we analyse extreme time series and build a simulator of extreme time series. 
-This project is based on existing methods in the literature such as regularly varying functions, extreme value model and polar decomposition. 
-We also propose several methods to validate our method, using extreme value theory, PCA decomposition and classification two-samples test.

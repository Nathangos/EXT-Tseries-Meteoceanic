# EXT-Tseries-Meteoceanic
Simulation of univariate extreme time series accounting for temporal dependence

For better modelling surge-induced coastal flooding, we analyse extreme time series and build a simulator of extreme time series. 
Our main contributions are the following:
- Accounting for temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior. Use of regularly varying functions, extreme value model and polar decomposition. 
- Dimensionality reduction to simulate new extreme time series based on copula models. 
- Tunable aspects, allowing to produce consecutive extremes.
- Several methods proposed to validate the simulation method, using extreme value theory, PCA decomposition and classification two-samples test.
